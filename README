the paths in the project are native to my mac, so you'll have to put your own path if you want this to function.
also please mind the GUI its not pretty. 
the three sites that are supported: 
mangapanda
mangapark 
kissmanga 

![Manga Finder Demo](./ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)

coming in the future: DC and marvel comics (I just need the time to get around to implementing more sources) 
I hope you enjoy this project as much as I had fun making it, don't be afraid to email me and critisize me I thrive on it.
